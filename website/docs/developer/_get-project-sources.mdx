## Get project sources

The project is hosted on GitHub:

- https://github.com/xpack/logger-ts.git

The project uses two branches:

- `master`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `development`, with the current development version

To clone the stable branch (`master`), run the following commands in a
terminal (on Windows use the Git Bash console):

```sh
mkdir ~/Work/npm-modules && cd ~/Work/npm-modules
git clone https://github.com/xpack/logger-ts.git logger-ts.git
```

For **development** purposes, clone the `development` branch:

```sh
mkdir ~/Work/npm-modules && cd ~/Work/npm-modules
git clone \
  --branch development \
  https://github.com/xpack/logger-ts.git logger-ts.git
```

Or, if the repo was already cloned:

```sh
git -C ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git pull
```
