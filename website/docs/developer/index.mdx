# How to build the xPack Logger

This page is designed for developers of the
**xPack Logger**
project and provides documentation on how to build and test the package.

<Prerequisites nodeVersion="18.0.0" nodeVersionMajor="18"/>

<GetProjectSources />

## Satisfy dependencies

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git install
```

## Add links for development

To facilitate the use of this module in other packages, add a link
from the central npm storage to this local development folder:

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git link
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
npm link @xpack/logger
```

## Start the compile background task

The TypeScript compiler can automatically recompile modified files. For
this, start it in `watch` mode.

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git run compile-watch
```

## Language standard compliance

The current version is compiled with TypeScript 4.9.5:

- https://www.typescriptlang.org
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook

The compiler is configured to produce `es2020` & `commonjs` files,
which means ECMAScript6 with legacy CommonJS modules, that can be imported
by any other project either via `require()`Â or `import`.

For more details on how to configure `tsconfig.json`, please see:

- [TSConfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/)

## Standard style

As style, the project uses `ts-standard`, the TypeScript variant of
[Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/#typescript),
automatically checked at each commit via CI.

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-xxx-yyy
```

The known rules are documented in the
[typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules)
project.

Generally, to fit two editor windows side by side in a screen,
all files should limit the line length to 80.

```js
/* eslint max-len: [ "error", 80, { "ignoreUrls": true } ] */
```

Known and accepted exceptions:

- none

To manually fix compliance with the style guide (where possible):

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`% npm run fix

> @xpack/logger@${customField('version')} fix
> ts-standard --fix src && standard --fix test
...
`} </CodeBlock>

## Documentation metadata

The documentation metadata uses the
[TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) tags, without
explicit types, since they are provided by TypeScript.

:::note

Microsoft is currently developing a new project ([TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org))
which tries to standardise TypeScript documentation metadata.

This standard is generaly compatible with TypeDoc; at the time of
this writing, among the visible differences is the lack
of the `@category` or `@group` tags.

## Tests

The tests use the [`node-tap`](http://www.node-tap.org) framework
(_A Test-Anything-Protocol library for Node.js_, written by Isaac Schlueter).

Tests can be written in TypeScript, assuming `ts-node` is also installed
(https://node-tap.org/docs/using-with/#using-tap-with-typescript)

As for any `npm` package, the standard way to run the project tests is via
`npm run test`:

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git install
npm --prefix ~/Work/npm-modules/logger-ts.git run test
```

<TestResults />


### Coverage tests

Coverage tests are a good indication on how much of the source files is
exercised by the tests. Ideally all source files should be covered 100%,
for all 4 criteria (statements, branches, functions, lines).

Thus, passing coverage tests was enforced for all tests, as seen before.

#### Coverage exceptions

Exclusions are marked with `/* istanbul ignore next */` for
[istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md)
and `/* c8 ignore start */` `/* c8 ignore stop */` for
[c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8).

- none


### Continuous Integration (CI)

The module is tested with 100% coverage and
CI tested on every push via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/logger-ts/actions), on Ubuntu,
Windows and macOS, using node 18 and 20.

## Tricks & tips

To trace TypeScript module resolution:

```json
    "compile": "tsc --traceResolution  -p ./",
```
