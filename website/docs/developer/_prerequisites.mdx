## Prerequisites

The **xPack Logger** is a portable Node.js project, and development can be
performed on macOS, GNU/Linux and even Windows (although some npm scripts
require bash).

The prerequisites are:

- node >= 18.0.0
- npm

To ensure compatibility with older node, preferably revert to an older one:

```sh
nvm use --lts 18
code
```
