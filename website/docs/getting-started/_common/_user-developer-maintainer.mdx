:::info Separate User/Contributor/Maintainer pages

To meet the specific needs of different
audiences, this site features separate
**[User's Guide](/docs/user/)**,
**[Contributor's Guide](/docs/developer/)** and
**[Maintainer's Guide](/docs/maintainer/)**
pages. This way, each group can easily find the information and resources
most relevant to them.
