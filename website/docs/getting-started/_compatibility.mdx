### v6.0.0

The TypeScript code is compiled into
**CommonJS** modules, with an **ES6** wrapper, and can be consumed by both
TypeScript and JavaScript packages.

There were also some minor internal renames, but this should not be
a problem.

The function `isLevel(level)` was added.

### v5.0.0

For consistency reasons, `hasLevel` was changed from a method to an
accessor.

Internally, the log level starts as `undefined` instead of the
string `'undefined'`, as in previous versions.

This should not be a problem, given that the method to check if
the level was set is via `hasLevel()`.

### v4.0.0

The code was migrated to TypeScript.

The migration itself should not introduce any incompatibilities,
actually it should be fairly compatible with the latest v3.x,
but, for just in case, the safer path was to consider it a major
release.

### v3.0.0

All `isXyx` functions (returning a boolean related to
the log level) were changed to accessors.

### v2.0.0

The logger constructor was changed to use a generic
parameters object.

If upgrading from previous versions, change the syntax from:

```javascript
const log = new Logger(console, 'info')
```

to:

```javascript
const log = new Logger({
  console,
  level: 'info'
})
```
