In **{props.date || 'DATE'}**, as part of the project restructuring,
the website content was migrated from the TypeDoc sub-site to a local
Docusaurus configuration within the `website` folder.
To ensure continuity, HTML `<meta>` redirects were added to the old pages.
 Additionally, a GitHub Action was set up to automatically publish
 the site whenever changes are pushed to the `website` Git branch.
