The project was created in **April 2017**, when it was extrated as
a separate project from the early **xpm** version.

The initial implementation used ECMAScript 2017, the first version
that supported async/await.

In **May 2021**, with v4.0.0, the project was migrated to TypeScript.

In **February 2023**, with v6.0.0, an **ES6** wrapper was added to the
**CommonJS** modules, and the module can be consumed by both
TypeScript and JavaScript packages.
