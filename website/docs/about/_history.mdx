The project was created in **April 2017**, when it was extrated as
a separate project from the early **xpm** version.

The initial implementation was based on ECMAScript 2017, the first
version to support async/await.

In **May 2021**, with the release of version 4.0.0, the project
was migrated to **TypeScript**.

In **February 2023**, version 6.0.0 introduced an **ES6** wrapper for
the **CommonJS** modules. This addition allows the module to be used
with TypeScript as well as both new and legacy JavaScript packages.
