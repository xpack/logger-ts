# How to use the xPack Logger

This section is intended for those who plan to use this module in their
own projects.

The `@xpack/logger` module can be imported into both TypeScript
and JavaScript Node.js code.

In TypeScript and ECMAScript modules, use `import`:

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@xpack/logger'
```

In JavaScript with CommonJS, use `require()`:

```javascript
const { Logger } = request('@xpack/logger')
```

The module can be included in any application and the class can be used
directly or a custom class can be derived from it for a custom behaviour.

The typical use case is to create an instance of the `Logger` object,
then log messages at different levels:

```javascript
const log = new Logger({
  level: 'info'
})

log.info('hello') // Displayed on stdout.
log.debug('world') // Ignored.
```

In more complex use cases, the log level can be tested and the (possibly)
long operations be performed only if necessary.

### Log levels

The following strings are recognised as valid level names:

```typescript
export type LogLevel =
  'silent' | 'error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'verbose' | 'debug' | 'trace' | 'all'
```

Internally the string levels are converted to integer values,
and these integers are used in comparisons. Higher values
mean more verbosity.

### Delaying setting the log level

There are cases when the logger must be created very early in the
life cycle of an application, even before it is practically possible
to determine the log level.

For these cases, if the logger is created without a log level,
it is set to a **preliminary state**, and all log lines are
stored in an internal buffer**, until the log
level is set, when the buffer is walked and the lines are processed.

```javascript
const log = new Logger()
log.trace('...') // Not shown immediately
log.level = 'trace' // Set level and show the buffered messages.

log.info('hello') // Displayed on stdout.
log.debug('world') // Ignored.
```

### Output methods

The following methods are available to log messages:

- `always (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `error (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `error (message: Error): void`
- `output (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `warn (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `info (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `verbose (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `debug (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
- `trace (message: any = '', ...args: any[]): void`
