# How to install the xPack Logger

## Prerequisites

A recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=18.0.0), since the TypeScript code
is compiled into ECMAScript 2020 code, and the tests use ES6 modules.

## Install

The module is available as
[`@xpack/logger`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack/logger/)
from the public [`npmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com) repository;
it can be added as a dependency to any TypeScript or JavaScript
project with `npm install`:

```console
npm install @xpack/logger@latest
```

The module does not provide any executables, and generally there are no
reasons to install it globally.

## Uninstall

As any Node.js module, it can be uninstalled:

```console
npm uninstall @xpack/logger
```
